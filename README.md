# Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is my first Python project! I built a command-line game where the computer picks a number, and you have to guess it.

**What I added to make it interesting:**
* **Difficulty Levels:** You can choose Easy (10 tries) or Medium (7 tries) or Hard (3 tries).
* **Play Again:** You don't need to restart the code to play again.
* **Clean UI:** The screen clears automatically after every game.

**What I learned:**
* How to use `functions` and `loops`.
* handling user inputs (so the game doesn't crash).
* Using Python libraries like `random` and `os`.

**How to run:**
